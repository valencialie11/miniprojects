# Mini Projects

## List of mini projects
- Guess The Number 
- Hangman
- Password Generator (My approach is slightly different in such a way that I'm using a series of passwords taken online of different characters and lengths and randomise it to suit the user's needs, instead of making random passwords for the user from scratch, but will try to change it or upload a different version)
- Text Based Game (based on a novel that my boyfriend and I just finished reading. Go and check out Karen M. McManus' One Of Us Is Lying.)

Hi! It's me again! I'm back with a series of mini projects to strengthen my foundation in python. 

Although they look very simple,
I'm very proud of these mini projects because this is the first time I'm coding something from scratch, and to think about it, I should have done this way earlier before the game with arcade. (Though admittedly that looks a lot cooler HAHA)

Another reason why I'm very proud of these is because I initially learnt python solely for data science/data analytics and so I've never undergone any formal/online training on how to develop something using python and this is the very first time I actually explored on that by myself and I learnt a lot.

I'm really enjoying coding on my own and I hope this folder will be full of mini projects and games by the time I start uni in August. Fingers crossed I will keep on being this enthusiastic in the future.

Signing off ~
